Subject: Clarification on Tax Deductions and H-1B Filing

Dear [HR Representative’s Name],

I hope you are doing well. I have a couple of questions regarding my current employment and future visa status, and I would appreciate your guidance.
	1.	Medicare and Social Security Taxes – As per IRS guidelines, F-1 visa holders on OPT are typically exempt from Medicare and Social Security (FICA) taxes. I noticed these deductions on my paycheck and wanted to check if this was applied correctly to my status. Could you confirm if these withholdings are necessary in my case?
	2.	H-1B Filing – I understand that my employment is subject to a probationary period. Would this affect my eligibility for H-1B sponsorship through the lottery? Since I only have three chances before my F-1 OPT expires, I wanted to confirm if the company is planning to file for my H-1B this year.

I appreciate your time and assistance in clarifying these concerns. Please let me know if you need any additional information from my end.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Sai Krishna Yalamanchili
